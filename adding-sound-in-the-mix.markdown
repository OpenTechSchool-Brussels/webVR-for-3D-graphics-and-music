VR is not only visual, you can easily make it multimodal with some located sound.

## a) Playing sound
* triggering a sound
* triggering a sound when close to an object.
// Rez: 4 cubes, 4 different saxophone on each.

## b) Playing a 3D sound
* the closer you are, the louder it is
// Rez: we add a looping "nappe" or bass stuff from an added cub in the middle

## c) Stereo in 3D
* turning left/right change repartition of sound in each ears.
// Rez: 1 cube that translate along a circle (Translate along a circle centered on the person? (accumulating them?)).

## d) Bi aurial (or whatever the name is) sound
* locating each ear in the 3D space
// Rez: lots of "rectangular high person-like" cubes, with them talking.

## e) "Project"
*moving cubes around, organizing the space cognitively and musically
