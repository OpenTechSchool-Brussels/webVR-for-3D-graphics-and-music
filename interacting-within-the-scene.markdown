The question of how to interact when having a VR head set doesn't really have a definite answer yet. Let's see what we can already do with a simple bluetooth controller.

## a) Moving around
* triggering event by key pressed
* moving the camera (speed)
// Rez: moving in all four directions

* feel: Exploring the scene you created before
* Boundaries (Scene borders) &  (discs around cubes)
// Rez: the above...


## b) Activating Objects
* (tweening ?)
* triggering event by proximity
* changing objects (size, colour, position...)
// Rez: When close to an object (still block) change colour

* Billy Jean: disco ground
// Rez: white "Cubes" as tiles on the ground with no "boundaries", when you're close to them they take a color
// Labyrinth

## c) Moving Objects
* triggering event by "ray casting" (proximity + direction)
* Locking an object
* Keeping object in front of you (what about rotation?)
* Releasing it (I would say with no fall => a more Sci Fi kind of look)
// Rez: Lock & Release objects (3D)
