The question of how to interact when having a VR head set doesn't really have a definite answer yet. Let's see what we can already do with a simple bluetooth controller.

## a) Moving around
* triggering event by key pressed
* moving the camera (speed)
* scene boundaries (size)
* feel: Exploring the scene you created before
* Either no physic, or just a disk around cubes (no matter their height and position in space) projected on the ground that the player can't enter.
* tweening

## b) Activating Objects
* triggering event by proximity
* changing objects (size, colour, position...)
* Billy Jean: disco ground

## c) Moving Objects
* triggering event by "ray casting" (proximity + direction)
* Locking an object
* Keeping object in front of you
* Releasing it (I would say with no fall => a more Sci Fi kind of look)
