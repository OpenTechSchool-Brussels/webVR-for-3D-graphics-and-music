## a) How to define your scene
* webpage
* file

## b) Creating a door to switch scenes
* Room (or dome) like scene
* Generate scene
* When entering the door, generate new scene

## c) Linking between existing scenes
* files e.g. http://vatelier.net/webVR-for-3D-graphics-and-music/Code/linked_webVR_demo1.html
* webpages
* inside the whole renderer
* extending the specs http://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html

Note: if you are using https://webVR.neocities.org to host your page we will try to make a central page https://webVR.neocities.org/entrance/ to enter other scenes.
