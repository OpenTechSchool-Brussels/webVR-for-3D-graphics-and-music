Same as previously : This workshop is still in beta, and you're getting to the bleeding edge part of it! Here are more ideas to explore than actual code to run. Feel free to explore the possibilities and if you have any questions or issues, be sure to refer to the coaches :) Enjoy the ride, even if now a bit more bumpy! And if you have any comments, please tell us, this part ( and the previous) is a work in progress and is meant to be released for the next workshop.


(Stateful? update on time of last modification of file)

## a) How to define your scene
* webpage
* file

## b) Creating a door to switch scenes
* Room (or dome) like scene
* Generate scene
* When entering the door, generate new scene

## c) Linking between existing scenes
* files e.g. http://vatelier.net/webVR-for-3D-graphics-and-music/Code/linked_webVR_demo1.html
* webpages
* inside the whole renderer
* extending the specs http://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html

Note: if you are using https://webvr.neocities.org to host your page we will try to make a central page http://webvr.neocities.org/entrance/index.html to enter other scenes.
