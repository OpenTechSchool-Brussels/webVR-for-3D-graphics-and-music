title:  "Welcome to amaaaazing WebVR for graphics and music!"
---

<p>In this workshop, you will discover Virtual Reality (VR), run your first program and you will build a virtual reality environment. Our objective today: to be able to participate to the webVR revolution instead of taking the VR wave in the face and solely consuming what is offered. What does it mean? I'm glad you asked. We will learn together how to create 3D graphics on the web and how to display them over a VR head set. Then we will create a brave new world and interact with its objects would that be moving them around, or triggering sounds from them. Last, we'll wonder about new potential interfaces and cherry on the cake: how to link virtual worlds together and create a VR web.</p>

<p> While we have a red thread to follow, there is no ideal world to show in the end. There is no target except learning while enjoying the day. If at the end of the day you have something gorgeous you want to show to the world, great; but if you end up with just ideas and a better understanding of how you will be able to make them happen in the next few weeks, it's also great! </p>

<p>Some fundamental advices for beginner programmers (you might want to come back here if you have issues):
<ol>
<li><b>Get your hands dirty.</b> You'll only learn if you write and run some code. Each piece of code shared has some meaning, would that be for educational purpose, or just to show some neat visualisation. Run them all, and don't hesitate to tweak them, push them forward and explore both your sensibility and what you can do with it.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing.</b> You need to understand each line of your code, especially in this workshop since we'll probably reuse them and make you modify them short after. If you're not 100% you understand, reread the course. Maybe try the next paragraph. Ask a fellow student, a coach, search online... Anything, but don't continue if you don't understand.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing!</b> It's fundamental to understand the grammar of your lines of code, but it's as important to understand its meaning, and place in your code. You're coding your line at a specific place, it has a specific role. Understand that role. Not only of your line but also of your group of lines so that a structure of your code emerge. Sometimes you'll be asked to replace some code, it'll be up to you to understand what to replace.</li>
<li><b>Don't copy paste.</b> While it might seem as a quick way to advance the material, you will learn less. The more you will write, the more you will remember. And even better, whenever there are number used, try to tweak them, modify them a bit, see what happens.</li>
<li><b>Regularly clean your code.</b> It's easy to get lost, even more when you're discovering something new. Cleaning your code means getting rid (or commenting) unused part of the code, so you don't surcharge your code and wonder where is that specific part you're looking for. It means too organising it, so you can infer better meaning from it. And last, the graphic structure. Don't forget to indent (put space at the start of the line) when you enter a new block of code, it eases both the reading and the spotting of bugs.</li>
<li><b>Learn how to search out the answer when you're stuck.</b> You are part of a group during the workshop, you can always ask the other students, or the coaches but it's a good reflex to always try to find out by yourself why there is an issue and how to solve it. You can search the Processing reference page, tutorials, forums or even post a question online yourself (knowing how to post a good question would need its own tutorial too...).</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll be creating many amazing stuff during this workshop, be proud, and don't forget to spread the love. Take pictures, send them on our meetup or tweet about it @OTSBxl.</p>

<p>Now that we got to know each other, let's dive into the course itself.</p>
