## a) Displaying a floating interface
* visuals that follows the head
* text and rectangles and ....
* Display a Map on top (location of cubes), and other stuff on the sides.


## b) Alternating between still world and still interface
* switchable modes of interactions
... Not sure if it actually makes sense, need to try, and if it doesn't, need to find another way to do so.


## c) Interacting with the interface
* What action of the items of the menu ?
* simultaneously ?!

## d) Located interface
* added information on top of other objects (ex: descrition of a cube and the sound, inspiration from biology drawing)
