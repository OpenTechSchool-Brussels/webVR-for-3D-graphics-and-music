# webVR-ftw
 Course on webVR, made for OTS Brussels.

 To improve:
 - Doing it "right" cf tips in [Mozilla pain points](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/WebVR_concepts#Eye_strain) or [Oculus Best Practices](http://static.oculus.com/sdk-downloads/documents/Oculus_Best_Practices_Guide.pdf) but basically making a scene as realistic as possible while minimizing visual and cognitive strain, NOW your cognitive science classes become useful!
 - Gallery and examples (e.g. [WebGL VR Tumblr](http://webglvr.tumblr.com) or [r/webVR](https://www.reddit.com/r/webvr) and obviously publishing your work on [Google Cardboard PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3001527_cardboard_apps) )
 - Annexes (Mathematics of stereoscopy](http://blog.cunnington.co.za/2010/09/14/mechanics-mathematics-of-stereoscopy/) and of the [gyro](http://www.cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/gyroscope_physics.php) )
 - Going with further with shaders https://www.shadertoy.com http://glslsandbox.com http://stack.gl and WegGL directly https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/RawWebGL/
