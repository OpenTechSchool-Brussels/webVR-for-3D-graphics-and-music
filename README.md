# webVR-ftw
 Course on webVR, made for OTS Brussels.
 
 To Do for next version of material:
 
 * Get rid of already legacy code: why starting with a Square renderer when after you're full screen?
 * We start with a far away camera, and then a super close by one. Be coherent (and be close by).
 * Use a local version of three.js, if not sometimes it's not working. (don't use the min three.js)
 * offering the possibility to use CARDBOARD DEBUG something.... to force splitting.
 * Get a working light code (try with flat shadding)
 * Get coherent values all along.
 * Reorder the workshop (and think back on the lenght of SettingUp) so that: after 15 min : cube in 3D, after 30 min: stereovision (if possible with head control)
 * Récupérer le code "control.reset"truc muche à la pression d'espace, histoire de pas avoir de torticolis...
 * Add ways to "stop" the music, or loop it.
