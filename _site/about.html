    <span id="Roman" class="authorName">Roman Miletitch</span>: I am a PhD student at IRIDIA (Belgium) in artificial intelligence and works in parallel as a technological artist. I've been highly interested in the writing of code as a creative process and the liberty that emerges when a programming language is seen as any other language. I've been working my fair share on gesture and its visualisation, as well as new kinds of interaction. Always eager to work on new projects, hit me up!
