If you want to go further, here are quick thought about what you can do: 

* animating your objects fluently
 * import [Tween.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweenjs/tween.js/master/src/Tween.js] then learn how to add a new Tween() on a cube or even the camera (anybody said roller coaster?) thanks to the [user guide](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md) in particular so that you don't forget Tween.update() in your animate loop.
* Develop a module for this workshop e.g.
 * motion (e.g. Kinect, Leap, etc) interfaces driven by Gilles
 * smartwatch interfaces driven by Fabien
* Doing it "right" cf tips in [Mozilla pain points](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/WebVR_concepts#Eye_strain) or [Oculus Best Practices](http://static.oculus.com/sdk-downloads/documents/Oculus_Best_Practices_Guide.pdf) but basically making a scene as realistic as possible while minimizing visual and cognitive strain, NOW your cognitive science classes become useful!
* Gallery and examples (e.g. [WebGL VR Tumblr](http://webglvr.tumblr.com) or [r/webVR](https://www.reddit.com/r/webvr) and obviously publishing your work on [Google Cardboard PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3001527_cardboard_apps) )
* Annexes including mathematics of [stereoscopy](http://blog.cunnington.co.za/2010/09/14/mechanics-mathematics-of-stereoscopy/) and of the [gyro](http://www.cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/gyroscope_physics.php)
* Getting closer to the metal [RawWebGL](https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/RawWebGL/) with shaders e.g. https://www.shadertoy.com http://glslsandbox.com or http://stack.gl
* Looking at alternatives beside ThreeSJ and Google Cardboard e.g. [VR Market Ecosystem map](https://medium.com/@mccannatron/virtual-reality-vr-market-ecosystem-map-e6090af2e2af)
