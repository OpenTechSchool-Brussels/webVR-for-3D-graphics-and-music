Let's get it started.


## o) What is Virtual Reality?
* text

## a) Discover WebGL/threeJS
* What is webGL (GL on the web, using Javascript, if you're unsure ..... you can check cheatsheet here, or tutorial here).
* Little iFrame with webGL test (to test navigator, both computer and smartphone)
* Why threeJS?

## b) Running your first program in threeJS
* 3D working example on your cpu

## c) Putting your code on a server
VR will be seen from your phone, so you need it to be accesible by your phone, online, from a server.
Good too to share with others.

For that need of code on a server. Either your own (local or not) if you know how, if not, github (code hosting plateform) allows one to do so, with gh pages. In order to do so....

## d) Virtual Reality Vs classic 3D rendering
* new way to render

## e) One possibilty for VR: webVR
* uploading the page on our server (and small tuto on how to do it on your own when you're back home)
