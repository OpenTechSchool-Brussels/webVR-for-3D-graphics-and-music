## a) Displaying (and seeing!) a 3D cube
* 3D primitive
* camera
* moving the primitive (rot & trans?)
// Rez: Seeing a 3D cube

## b) Setting up the stage
* floor
* light (type of light)
* properties of a primitive (size, colour)
* type of primitive
// Rez: Whole stage (all the above)

## c) Baby step in Virtual Reality
* stereoscopic effect
// Rez: two renderers of the same scene
* camera follow head movement
** relative Vs absolute coordiantes
** Object moving (various speed) (forcing the player to look around)
// Rez: head movement...  

## d) A bit is nice, a lot is nice too
* Many cubes (with or without movement, different size)
* Creating a landscape from it (can't see anymore the floor with all the cubes on it)
// Rez: Random cubes Landscape.

Until now, you could only look aroud and act as a sensor, let's change that!
