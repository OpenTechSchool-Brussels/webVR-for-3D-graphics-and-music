## a) Displaying (and seeing!) a 3D cube
* 3D primitive
* camera
* light (type of light)
* properties of a primitive (size, colour)

## b) Baby step in Virtual Reality
* floor
* stereoscopic effect
* camera follow head movement
* relative Vs absolute coordiantes (? pour quel usage ?)

* Object moving (various speed) (forcing the player to look around)

## c) A bit is nice, a lot is nice too
* Many cubes (with or without movement, different size)
* Creating a landscape from it (can't see anymore the floor with all the cubes on it)

Until now, you could only look aroud and act as a sensor, let's change that!
